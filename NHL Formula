The formula only went four for six, so I think there's room for improvement. For February 5th, I'm going to swap out the defense ranking with the GOA of the opposing team. The end result is always way too low, so I will multiply the final result by three.

New_Formula = Goals_Per_Game(GPG) + (Coaching / 10) + (Weather / 30) - Opp_GOA - (Opposing_Coach / 20) + Momentum

According to to the website www.underdogchance.com, the two most important statistics are Corsi and expected goals (xG). I believe Corsi is connected to total shot attempts per game.

February 8, 2025

After going one for five last night, it really seems like the games become more unpredictable throughout the course of the week. I'm going to add a variable for the day of the week to see if it helps with the accuracy. I encountered the same issue when I tried to create a formula for baseball games.

pred_Chi = 2.77
pred_StL = 2.20 + 0.6 = 2.80

actual_Chi = 5
actual_StL = 6

pred_NYR = 3.13 + 0.6 = 3.73
pred_CBJ = 3.60

actual_NYR = 4
actual_CBJ = 3

pred_Ott = 3.21 + 0.6 = 3.81
pred_Fla = 3.56

actual_Ott = 1
actual_Fla = 5

pred_Pit = 2.97
pred_Phi = 2.43 + 0.6 = 3.03

actual_Pit = 2
actual_Phi = 3

pred_Tor = 3.44
pred_Van = 2.96 + 0.6 = 3.56

actual_Tor = 1
actual_Van = 2

pred_Buf = 3.35
pred_Nsh = 2.83 + 0.6 = 3.43

actual_Buf = 4
actual_Nsh = 6

pred_NYI = 2.98 + 0.6 = 3.58
pred_Min = 3.01

actual_NYI = 3
actual_Min = 6

pred_Dal = 3.75
pred_SJS = 2.64 + 0.6 = 3.24

actual_Dal = 8
actual_SJS = 3

pred_Sea = 3.00
pred_Cal = 2.80 + 0.6 = 3.40

actual_Sea = 3
actual_Cal = 2

pred_Ana = 2.69 + 0.6 = 3.29
pred_LA  = 3.16

actual_Ana = 2
actual_LA  = 1

Based on the results from Friday night (where adding 0.5 to the score of every underdog really would've helped), for a Saturday night, I will add 0.6 to the score of every underdog.  

Monday = 0.1
Tuesday = 0.2
Wednesday= 0.3
Thursday = 0.4
Friday  = 0.5
Saturday = 0.6
Sunday  = 0.7

day_of_the_week = ({'Monday': 0.1, 'Tuesday': 0.2, 'Wednesday': 0.3, 'Thursday': 0.4, 'Friday': 0.5, 'Saturday': 0.6, 'Sunday': 0.7}) 

Thanks to the day of the week variable, I went 7 for 10 on Saturday night. If I hadn't included the day of the week variable, I would've gone 4 for 10.

From now on, I'm going to avoid games involving Buffalo, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Las Vegas, Minnesota, New York Islanders, Seattle, and Utah.

February 9, 2025

pred_Uta = 3.01
pred_Was = 3.89

actual_Uta = 5
actual_Was = 4

pred_TB  = 3.85
pred_Mtl = 3.70

actual_TB  = 5
actual_Mtl = 3

Final_Formula = Goals_Per_Game(GPG) + (Coaching / 10) + (Weather / 30) - (1 / Opp_GOA) - (Opposing_Coach / 20) + Momentum + day_of_the_week

eq1 = Eq(GPG + (Coaching / 10) + (Weather / 30) - (1 / Opp_GOA) - (Opposing_Coach / 20) + Momentum + day_of_the_week)


February 10, 2025

#The Four Nations Cup spans two weeks, so I'm going to wrap up this analysis. 

#Conclusions

-It's crucial to take the day of the week into account.
-Even after taking the day of the week into account, the formula isn't accurate enough to generate a good profit.
-It would probably be better to use the starting goalie's GOA instead of the team average.

I really need to determine if I should use (33- Opp_GOA_Ranking)/32 or 1/Opp_GOA for the defense variable.

February 15, 2025

After analyzing scores from January 2025, I determined that 1/Opp_GOA is a poor measure of defense because the maximum difference between two teams in less than 0.2 goals. However, the defense variable isn't nearly as important as I thought it would be, so I'm going to increase the denominator to 35.

After adjusting the defense variable, the formula yielded the following results for February 9, 2025:

Uta  3.17
Was  3.67

TB   4.08
Mtl  3.29

These predictions were far more accurate, and I'm hoping I won't need to modify the formula in the future. 

Final_Formula = Goals_Per_Game(GPG) + (Coaching / 10) + (Weather / 30) - (33 - Opp_GOA_Ranking / 35) - (Opposing_Coach / 20) + Momentum + day_of_the_week

The oddsmaker's predictions in the "to win" column on the Foxsports website are pretty accurate in terms of margin of victory.

February 17, 2025

I'm worried that the oddsmaker's NHL predictions on Foxsports are more accurate than mine, so I'm going to check their accuracy for the two weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face Off. I expect their accuracy will be highest on Monday's and gradually drop throughout the course of the week.

I want to be ready to use the formula when the NHL returns on February 22nd, so I'm going to test it on games from January 31st.

pred_Nsh  =  3.03 + 0.5 = 3.53
pred_Buf  =  3.42

actual_Nsh = 3
actual_Buf = 4

pred_Van   = 2.55 + 0.5 = 3.05
pred_Dal   = 3.48

actual_Van = 3
actual_Dal = 5

pred_StL   = 2.73 + 0.5 = 3.23
pred_Col   = 3.57

actual_StL  = 0
actual_Col  = 5

pred_CbJ    = 3.44
pred_Uta    = 3.06 + 0.5 = 3.56

actual_CbJ  = 3
actual_Uta  = 2

Conclusion: If the day of the week flips the score, don't pick the game.

February 19, 2025

Flow chart for picking NHL games on February 22:
1. Calculate scores with NHL formula
2. Compare scores to oddsmaker's predictions
3. Check if the games include the nine most inconsistent teams
4. Do not pick teams that are predicted to win only because of the day of the week variable.
