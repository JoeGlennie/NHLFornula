#How do I make my NBA formula better?
#Should I simply avoid the ten inconsistent teams?
#Would it work better with NHL games since they dress 22 versus 12 in the NBA?

The formula works reasonably well, but I am going to change the defense ranking denominator to 20 to see if helps make with the margin of victory.

The formula only went four for six, so I think there's room for improvement. For February 5th, I'm going to swap out the defense ranking with the GOA of the opposing team. The end result is always way too low, so I will multiply the final result by three.

February 8, 2025

After going one for five last night, it really seems like the games become more unpredictable throughout the course of the week. I'm going to add a variable for the day of the week to see if it helps with the accuracy. I encountered the same issue when I tried to create a formula for baseball games.

pred_Chi = 2.77
pred_StL = 2.20 + 0.6 = 2.80

actual_Chi = 5
actual_StL = 6

pred_NYR = 3.13 + 0.6 = 3.73

Based on the results from Friday night (where adding 0.5 to the score of every underdog really would've helped), for a Saturday night, I will add 0.6 to the score of every underdog.  

Monday = 0.1
Tuesday = 0.2
Wednesday= 0.3
Thursday = 0.4
Friday  = 0.5
Saturday = 0.6
Sunday  = 0.7

day_of_the_week = ({'Monday': 0.1, 'Tuesday': 0.2, 'Wednesday': 0.3, 'Thursday': 0.4, 'Friday': 0.5, 'Saturday': 0.6, 'Sunday': 0.7}) 

Thanks to the day of the week variable, I went 7 for 10 on Saturday night. If I hadn't included the day of the week variable, I would've gone 4 for 10.

From now on, I'm going to avoid games involving Buffalo, Chicago, Columbus, Detroit, Las Vegas, Minnesota, New York Islanders, Philidelphia, Seattle, and Utah.

#The Four Nations Cup spans two weeks, so I'm going to wrap up this analysis. 

#Conclusions

-It's crucial to take the day of the week into account.
-Even after taking the day of the week into account, the formula isn't accurate enough to generate a good profit.
-It would probably be better to use the starting goalie's GOA instead of the team average.

I really need to determine if I should use (33- Opp_GOA_Ranking)/32 or 1/Opp_GOA for the defense variable.

February 15, 2025

After analyzing scores from January 2025, I determined that 1/Opp_GOA is a poor measure of defense because the maximum difference between two teams in less than 0.2 goals. However, the defense variable isn't nearly as important as I thought it would be, so I'm going to increase the denominator to 35.

After adjusting the defense variable, the formula yielded the following results for February 9, 2025:

Uta  3.17
Was  3.67

TB   4.08
Mtl  3.29

These predictions were far more accurate, and I'm hoping I won't need to modify the formula in the future. 

Final_Formula = Goals_Per_Game(GPG) + (Coaching / 10) + (Weather / 30) - (33 - Opp_GOA_Ranking / 35) - (Opposing_Coach / 20) + Momentum + day_of_the_week

February 16, 2025

The oddsmaker's predictions in the "to win" column on the Foxsports website are pretty accurate in terms of margin of victory.

February 17, 2025

I'm worried that the oddsmaker's NHL predictions on Foxsports are more accurate than mine, so I'm going to check their accuracy for the two weeks leading up to the Four Nations Face Off. I expect their accuracy will be highest on Monday's and gradually drop throughout the course of the week.

I want to be ready to use the formula when the NHL returns on February 22nd, so I'm going to test it on games from January 31st.

Conclusion: If the day of the week flips the score, don't pick the game.

February 19, 2025

Flow chart for picking NHL games on February 22:
1. Calculate scores with NHL formula
2. Compare scores to oddsmaker's predictions
3. Check if the games include the nine most inconsistent teams
4. Do not pick teams that are predicted to win only because of the day of the week variable.

I don't think I'm ever going to find a variable that justifies most of the upsets in the NHL. In the NFL, the defensive ranking really helped predict upsets. I doubt I'll ever find a similar statistic in the NHL. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with travel or direction of travel (east versus west).

After checking the accuracy by day of the week for January 2025, it actually seems like the oddsmaker's peak on Thursday's and decline after that. I think the sample size for each day partially explains the trend, but I will check their results for December 2024 just to be sure.

For the Data Scientist final portfolio project, I'm going to analyze a csv file with all of the scores from December 2024 to the present day to see how accurate my NHL formula is. For the month I tracked the oddsmaker's results, they only achieved 61% accuracy. I really hope my formula is more accurate than whatever the oddsmaker's use. I don't think there's any way to plug the values from 
Since I will be using the Goals Per Game data instead of what the oddsmaker's predicted, I will need to dramatically reduce the impact of the Day of The Week variable. To start, I will check out how accurate the formula is for the two best teams in the league (Washington Capitals and Winnepeg Jets). I hypothesize that the formula will be more accurate for the best teams than the worst teams (Chicago Blackhawks and San Jose Sharks).
I also hypothesize that the formula will be less accurate for teams in the middle of the pack (New York Islanders and Vancouver Canucks).

I was not able to filter the columns for Winnipeg and Washington. 

I will post all of Winnipeg's and Washington's results for the month of January, 2025.
